# Component 4 - Symbol Table

This program is not yet functional.

A C++ program that creates a symbol table (a linked list) of all the defined variables (including their type and scope) and the names of all functions and procedures in an input file. Functions and procedures that have an input parameter list of variables and types will also be added (with appropriate scope) to the symbol table. Lastly, functions have a return datatype which will be noted in the symbol table as well.

## Running the program

This project can be run via make.

```make```

```./table.x```

If you have a Windows based machine, you will need to adjust the Makefile to generate a ```.exe``` executable, rather than ```.x```.

## Viewing the output 

After selecting "Symbol Table" from the menu and choosing a file, the program will generate an output file with the resutls. 

For example, if choosing ```Tests/Program4/programming_assignment_4-test_file_5.c```, the output can be found in ```st_test_file_5_output.txt```.
