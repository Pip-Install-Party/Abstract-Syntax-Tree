# Component 5 - Abstract Syntax Tree

A C++ program that creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based on the Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) that is generated via an input file. The program utilizes a LCRS binary tree (Left-Child, Right-Sibling) to store the AST. The resulting AST will be displayed in breadth-first order.

## Running the program

This project can be run via make.

```make```

```./tree.x```

If you have a Windows based machine, you will need to adjust the Makefile to generate a ```.exe``` executable, rather than ```.x```.
